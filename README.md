# 🗡️ Nidhogg Clone (Stickman Duel)

This is my attempt to recreate the cult classic game, Nidhogg, available on steam.

The result is a fast paced 2D dueling game, built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Two bitter rivals, Red Man and Blue Man, face off in eternal conflict for our amusement. The first to land 3 kills is victorious. That is, until you hit the restart key.
